                            Aquiles, an Argentine visual artist and Art Director, was born in 1991 to an art teacher and
                            workshop owner. Involved with art since childhood, he turns to those memories to create his world
                            of elements, palettes and shapes that consituate his artwork.

                        <p class="">
                            He began his artistic
                            career in 2010 at the age of 19, merging his passion for painting with his studies on Advertising
                            and ArtDirection. Even though his main strength is muralism, he's constantly seeking new ways
                            in which he can apply his art such as illustration, products, cinema and advertising.

                            About
                            three years ago he embarked on the journey to reflect his point of view abstractly, by revisiting
                            his essence, adapting his palette and repurposing his message.

                        <p class="">
                            His art has travelled
                            the world as he painted and exhibited in different cities in Europe such as Barcelona and Berlin,
                            Latin America and Los Angeles.

                            During the quarantine of 2020 he started working on his
                            'Lego'series which reflects through his large-scale paintings, his childhood, his
                            convictions and frustrations with the special ingredient of confinement.
